    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

 I am passionate about political economy, IDE and cultural economy, particularly interested in how democratic institutions(elections e.g.), cultural values, and global economic flows shape public policy, long-term
 development and national preference.  I seek to explore the institutional foundations of prosperity and contribute to evidence-based policymaking in an increasingly interconnected world.
