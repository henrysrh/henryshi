**Embed videos, podcasts, code, LaTeX math, and even test students!**

# On this page, you'll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Hugo Blox.

## Video

# Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:

# {{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

**Youtube**:

  #  {{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}

**Bilibili**:

 #   {{</* bilibili id="BV1WV4y1r7DF" */>}}

**Video file**

# Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

 #   {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}

## Podcast

# You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page's folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the _audio_ shortcode:

#    {{</* audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" */>}}

# Try it out:

# {{< audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" >}}
