**Travelling**: So far(till 2025) I've been to 15 countries and 27 Chinese provincial districts. Countries include: *KR, TH, RU, KH, VN, FR, DE, BE, CH, VA, AT, IT, SG, CN and MY*. I am interested in both natural and cultural landscapes, and I appreciate cross-cultural commnuication.

**Indie Films&Music**: Favorite artists include: *Quentin Tarantino, Peter Jackson*(for films) and *WastedLaika, Tayu Lo*(for music) etc.

**BP Debate**: Experiences in EDT and several Opens give abundant views of social issues from both progreessive and conservative sides.

**Election Tracking**: I focus closely on TW, US(also worldwide) elections and relevant academic, public researches and polls.
