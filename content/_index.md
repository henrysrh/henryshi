        I work hard to explore interactions between society and economics. In political economy and development economics, I track US/TW/HK elections and give economic analysis; I also focus on social movements like feminism development in China. In cultural economics, I care about social values and traditional culture's economic influence. My aim is to find applicable ways of peaceful evolution and introduce democratic solutions to economic prosperity.
